# Manga and Manhwa Updates Bot
> By Jerin Andrews

## Introduction
This project started due to my interest in manga and manhwa and the struggle I had to constantly keep up with my 200+ tabs of manhwa that I was reading at a time. It became really difficult to manage when a manhwa/manga updated without going through each tab one at a time. To fix this, I thought it would be convenient to have quick access and search to be able to find a manhwa/manga through webscraping a major manga/manhwa website and providing update times and ratings.
